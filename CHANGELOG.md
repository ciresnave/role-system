## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-19

### üöÄ Major Features Added

#### Enhanced Permission System

- **Enhanced Permission Constructors**: New methods for creating permissions with improved ergonomics
  - `Permission::with_context(resource, action, context)` - Create permissions with contextual information
  - `Permission::with_scope(resource, action, scopes)` - Generate multiple scoped permissions at once
  - `Permission::conditional(resource, action)` - Builder pattern for conditional permissions

#### Fluent RoleBuilder API

- **Enhanced RoleBuilder**: Powerful fluent API for creating roles with multiple permissions
  - `allow(resource, actions)` - Add multiple permissions with clean syntax
  - `deny(resource, actions)` - Add denial permissions for fine-grained control
  - `allow_when(resource, actions, condition)` - Add conditional permissions with context evaluation
  - Full backward compatibility with existing `permission()` and `permissions()` methods

#### Declarative Role Macros

- **`define_role!` macro**: Create single roles with declarative syntax

  ```rust
  let admin = define_role!(admin {
      users: ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
      system: ["configure", "monitor"]
  });
  ```

- **`define_roles!` macro**: Create multiple roles in bulk with clean syntax
- **`permission!` macro**: Shorthand for creating single or multiple permissions
- Enhanced macro support in existing `permissions!`, `role_with_permissions!`, and `subjects!` macros

#### Role Hierarchy System

- **`RoleHierarchy` struct**: Complete role inheritance system
  - `set_parent(child_id, parent_id)` - Establish parent-child relationships
  - `get_effective_permissions(role_id)` - Get all permissions including inherited
  - `has_permission(role_id, action, resource, context)` - Check permissions with inheritance
  - Circular dependency detection and prevention
  - Automatic permission aggregation from ancestor roles

#### Conditional Permission Builder

- **`ConditionalPermissionBuilder`**: Advanced builder for complex conditional logic
  - `when(condition)` - Add primary condition
  - `or_when(condition)` - Add alternative conditions with OR logic
  - `build()` - Finalize conditional permission
  - Context-dependent permission evaluation

- All existing APIs continue to work unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Smooth upgrade path for existing codebases

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-18

### Fixed

- **Critical Fix**: Resolved compilation error with `serde_json::Error` not implementing `Clone`
  - Changed `Serialization` error variant from `serde_json::Error` to `String`
  - Added custom `From<serde_json::Error>` implementation to preserve error messages
  - This fixes the build failure when using the crate with newer versions of `serde_json`
- **Code Quality**: Removed unused imports in temporal module

### Technical Details

The issue occurred because `serde_json` v1.0.96+ removed the `Clone` implementation from their `Error` type for security and API design reasons. Our error enum derived `Clone` but contained a `serde_json::Error` field, causing compilation failures.

**Solution**: Store the error message as a `String` instead of the raw `serde_json::Error`, with automatic conversion preserving all error information.
